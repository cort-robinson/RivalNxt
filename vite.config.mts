         * Honest scope note: this app ships as a Tauri bundle, loading assets from
         * the local filesystem rather than over a network. So unlike a web app,
         * this does NOT reduce download size or benefit from CDN caching, and the
         * total bytes parsed at startup are essentially unchanged — every chunk
         * below is a static import of the entry, so all of them load eagerly.
         *
         * What it does buy:
         *  - React and Radix churn far less often than app code, so incremental
         *    rebuilds and dev-server reloads touch much less output;
         *  - it clears Vite's >500 kB chunk warning, which was masking genuine
         *    regressions in the noise;
         *  - it makes `npm run build` output legible, so a future dependency
         *    bloat shows up against a named chunk instead of vanishing into one
         *    570 kB blob.
         *
         * The real startup win came from F5 (lazy modals), which removes code
         * from the eager graph entirely rather than merely relabelling it.
