"""Backup and restore of user state.

Backup was previously entirely frontend-side: a JSON file of mod metadata, with
the *index* of backups kept in ``localStorage`` under "rivalnxt:backups"
(src/lib/backupUtils.ts). There was no backend endpoint at all. Consequences:

* clearing webview storage orphaned every backup file on disk,
* ``mods.db`` itself was never backed up -- only a projection of it,
* ``settings.json`` was never backed up,
* nothing handled the ``-wal`` / ``-shm`` sidecars, so naively copying mods.db
  mid-session yields a torn snapshot.

This module makes the filesystem the source of truth and snapshots the real
database using SQLite's online backup API, which is WAL-safe by construction.
