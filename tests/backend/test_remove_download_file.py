"""Removing one pak from a mod, instead of the whole mod.

A mod often ships a dozen variants — A_rogueVA through VH, plus
separate physics and no-physics builds — and only one is wanted. The only option was deleting the entire
download.

The source archive is never touched. Removal records the pak in
mod_hidden_files and every read path filters against that record, so the file
stops being offered without local_downloads.contents being edited at all.

That indirection is the point. contents is rebuilt from the archive by every
ingest, so an edit there was undone by the next "Initial Database Build" while
the record survived — and because the entry really had been deleted, putting it
back needed a full rebuild. Filtering on read means a rebuild cannot resurrect a
hidden file, and restoring one is immediate.
